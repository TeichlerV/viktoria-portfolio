            <h4 class="mt-3">Overview</h4>
            <div class="project-text">
              Designed and developed a professional website for a Swedish
              painter, improving the business's credibility and online presence.
            </div>
            <h4 class="mt-3">Research</h4>
            <div class="project-text">
              Thoroughly analyzed the regional competition, consisting mainly of
              larger companies with practical-oriented websites. I, therefore,
              wanted this website to stand out, not only with a modern design
              but also with its simplicity and visual appeal to clients.
            </div>
            <h4 class="mt-3">Design</h4>
            <div class="project-text">
              Created an elegant and visually appealing website highlighting the
              painter's expertise in craftsmanship. The main image is therefore
              composed to show in an elegant way that the painter is good at
              both hand painting, pattern matching wallpapering, and working
              with color. Simplicity and visual appeal were prioritized to
              attract potential clients.
            </div>
            <h4 class="mt-3">User Experience</h4>
            <div class="project-text">
              Tested the website with users, ensuring easy navigation and an
              intuitive layout. Selected engaging colors and fonts for an
              enjoyable browsing experience.
            </div>
            <h4 class="mt-3">Results</h4>
            <div class="project-text">
              The painter loved the final design. The website achieved the goal
              of making the business look more serious and professional. People
              who visited the website found it easy, aesthetically appealing and
              gave positive responses.

                Successfully designed and developed a website for a medium in

                An analysis was conducted to see other mediums and psychics'
                websites and how they engage with their visitors. Most websites
                were white and my client wanted a more powerful website with her
                favorite color to stand out.

                The client describe herself as an ordinary mother of three and
                it was important to her to have a simple website. The logo
                incorporated her favorite flower, adding a personal touch,
                alongside a spiritual image to showcase the essence of her
                business. We aimed to create a balance between a mystical
                atmosphere and avoiding anything too creepy. This was
                accomplished by using a purple background, tasteful black
                details, and pictures.
